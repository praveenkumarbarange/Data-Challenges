Enterprise Data Governance Data Analysis

[Intro & Brief_Challenge 34_English (Updated).docx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/24587012/Intro.Brief_Challenge.34_English.Updated.docx)

As organizations consume more data across teams, tools, and platforms, data governance is no longer optional—it’s foundational. Many modern data ecosystems struggle with inconsistent definitions, poor data quality, unclear ownership, and increasing security and compliance risks, all of which reduce trust and limit the impact of analytics.

In this challenge, you’ll step into the role of a Data Governance Analyst or Analytics Leader to identify governance gaps and design a practical, business-ready framework. Your goal is to improve data trust, enable safe and responsible data usage, strengthen data culture, and support scalable, confident decision-making across the organization.


A few questions to help you with your analysis
Data governance is where analytics meets trust. As organizations scale across countries, systems, and regulations, the volume of data grows—but so does the risk: inconsistent definitions, missing ownership, uncontrolled access, low-quality records, and audit findings that arrive too late. In this environment, “reporting” is not the hard part; confidence is.

In this Data Challenge, you will step into the role of a Data Governance & Compliance Analyst for a fictional multinational organization operating across Europe. Your mission is to evaluate how well the organization governs its data assets across critical dimensions: quality, access control, lineage, policy compliance, audit readiness, and risk exposure. You will work with real-world governance signals—DQ scores, issue logs, audit results, ownership gaps, SLA breaches, and regulatory categories—across business domains and data products.

Your objective is clear:

Transform raw governance signals into actionable oversight (where the organization is safe, and where it is exposed).

Identify systemic breakdowns (recurring DQ failures, unresolved issues, missing ownership, weak controls, repeated audit findings).

Prioritize remediation using impact, likelihood, and cost-of-non-compliance logic—so leaders know what to fix first.

You are not just measuring metrics—you’re telling the story of trust. The best submissions will connect governance KPIs to business outcomes (risk, operational efficiency, decision confidence), and propose targeted improvements such as ownership models, controls, issue triage processes, monitoring frameworks, and compliance-by-design practices.

This challenge is designed to test not only your analytical and technical skills, but also your ability to build an executive-ready narrative: what’s happening, why it matters, what the organization should do next, and how success should be measured.
